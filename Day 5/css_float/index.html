        <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also
            called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from a population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by
            hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and
            before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the
            ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.

            Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary
            widely in shape, size, and color. .</p>
